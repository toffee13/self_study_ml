## Kinds of ML

### Supervised Learning  
 - Learning with labeled examples (Training Set)
 - Most common problem type in ML
 - e.g) Image Labeling, AlphaGo
 - Types of Supervised Learning
   - Regression : 범위별 구분 (e.g - 0~100)
   - Binary Classification : 이원화 구분 (e.g - Pass / Non-Pass)
   - Multi-Labeled Classification : 레이블화된 구분 (e.g - A, B, C, D, F)


### Unsupervised Learning : un-labeled data  
 - e.g) Google news grouping / Workld clustering
